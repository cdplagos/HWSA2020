# Session 1: Beginner Coding Workshop

This session will not teach an introduction to programming in Python, I am assuming that you already know some bits and pieces.  

Instead this session will introduce some useful concepts to help you improve how you write your code.
Examples are focused on Python, but the concepts are generally applicable to programming.

**Instructor**: Rebecca Lange, ADACS
