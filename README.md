## Instructions for Participants
Please note: all sessions of the school will be recorded. All participant cameras will be turned off by default.

### Rules:
1. **Sli.do should be used for questions.** We will have LOC members monitoring the chat and recording questions, which will be asked during the scheduled question times. 
2. **Please do not attempt to share your screen.**
3. **Turn your video off if your connection is slow.** We recommend keeping your video off, a least during the sessions, to try and minimise the internet traffic.

### Structure:
The day will begin in a single meeting before breaking out into parallel sessions.

You will automatically be assigned to the breakout room when the parallel sessions start, and you will have the option to:
1. Move to the breakout room
2. Stay in the main room

Whether you choose to stay or go, you will have the option to move freely between the rooms for the remainder of the day.

### Troubleshooting:
**INCASE OF MEETING FAILURE**<br>
Should the breakout room system fail we will have a separate zoom link set up for each session. These will be circulated to all participants via email in this event.

#### "I’ve become disconnected"
When you re-join the meeting you will be given the option to join the breakout room again. If your internet is unstable and you are disconnected repeatedly, we recommend keeping your video off. Remember that recordings of the sessions can always be watched at a later date.

#### "My zoom screen does not stay on the presenter’s slides"
You can ‘pin’ someone’s screen to always show by right clicking on their screen and selecting the pin option.
